# three_pinatas

A simple experiment in photogrammetry, using a common cell phone camera, agisoft software, and three.js.

I generated the 3D model for three_pinatas using photos I took of a colorful place in the SF Mission District that had many pinatas suspended overhead.  My exploration of photogrammetry coincided with a growing interest in "noise art" -- so I intentionally used a very small set of source photos to allow both 3D texture/form and interesting digital artifacts to surface and subsequently explore.  :)

I hope you like it!  I'll come back to this to include the source photos I used to generate my model at some point.

Thank you also to [Jimmy](https://github.com/jimmyland) for help with three.js!
